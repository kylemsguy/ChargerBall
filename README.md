# ChargerBall
A game where you use a charge gun to hit a ball instead of using a stick or other method.

Inspired by Splatoon (although created months before Octo Expansion was announced, and almost 9mo before it and its devious 8 ball levels was released)

This version was created for CSC404 in lieu of attending the Game Jam on September 16, 2017.

## Controls (default)
- WASD = Up/Left/Down/Right
- Space = Jump
- Left Mouse Button = Fire1 (Hold to charge, release to fire)
- Look = Mouse
